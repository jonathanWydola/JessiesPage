Ever since March 26th 2017, a pot has been stirring inside.
I simmer and simmer, only to overheat and boil over the lid.
My contents spill out, I simmer some more, but my patience is boiling.
Not sure what to make, but the water is ready, I must not be late.

I don't know how I have gotten this way, I'm obbsesing over a date.
It's a metaphor, for forever is tomorrow or this could be beginning.
Spinning down a twisted spiral, closer to reach the ending bid
Of how much your love will cost, to walk side by side, hand in hand.
