The warm breeze of mid summer's night,
calm air with a bright moonlight.
Everything so clear, with the ocean near
The salt water filled from their tears.
Aware, the winds change into a beast,
Right is west. Stuck in between. Left is east.
New beginnings never felt so old.
Especially when it starts off cold.
No where to go, staring into the light,
I have to know, is this my fear?
Courage, at it's very least.
Tame the beast! 
New beginnings.
