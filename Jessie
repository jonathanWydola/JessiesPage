Rain, drains down the love of tomorrows,

Never knowing the sorrows coming,

Washing, cleansing follows, beginning again,

Puddles pooling, drowning hollows, seeing an-end not-near,

Through thick humid haze, swallows meaning, prented it's-clear blindly,

Wallows, freeing an-end four-years slightly foreseeing,

Cold air, warm breeze, whatever comes will be ours to dream.
