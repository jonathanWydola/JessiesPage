Fish swim with the currents.
Shifting with the changes.
Stuck in between, pulling me down.
One current is warm, bright.
Another is cold, devoid of light.

Seeing both sides. I chose the right.
For the past haunts my choices.
I can't erase the past but I can write the future.

Right is the warm light.
But sometimes it shines too bright.
Enough to burn my skin and leave me scared
The sins of my past leave noticeable scars.
