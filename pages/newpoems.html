                    <p>Well, I figured since we don't/won't get much time together, that this could be a place for our memories, for our feelings, a place to grow.
                    of truth and honesty. Where we can express or rather, I can express my artistic emotions that sometimes don't get
                    displayed in a concrete way that you can view and be reminded just how much you mean to me.

                        I know you don't think I'm ready,</br>
                        Tough, sincere, or emotionally steady,</br>
                        But when I said I want you,</br>
                        genuinely I meant I would see it by through.</br>
                        You ask me to date, to see another,</br>
                        It's true I listened but I want this mother,</br>
                        Just let us explore and cuddle under the stars,</br>
                        It's a life I want more than the fancy cars.</br>
                        You make me happy, sleeping on the couch,</br>
                        Going to the beach, I was always a grouch.</br>
                        You can't deny we finish each other,</br>
                        I Will give you space to with another, </br>
                        No longer jealous or afraid of the future,</br>
                        We could flash like shiny pewter.</br>
                        It does not mean we have to fuck,</br>
                        or suck and quack like loving ducks,</br>
                        Times will be tough, I'm not asking for much,</br>
                        you would be the last, I want you forever and such.</br>
                        Now it's even tough your trapped inbetween,</br>
                        Me and you two different at the seam,</br>
                        Never felt so grounded for myself,</br>
                        Lifting me higher in helping yourself.</br>
                        The rhymes I find guidance,</br>
                        I believe the experience will enlighten,</br>
