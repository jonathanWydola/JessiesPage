                            the more this feels right. Their is no denying that the past month we have spent being
                            more than just friends has been fun, exciting, explorative, and at times romantic.
                            I am, more than ever, certain that we share a covealant bond similar to atoms missing electrons.
                            We aim for a balance among our own personal lives, and the life for our son. I know it's a give and take,
                            with times where we want to spend time together, while balancing our own lives apart and pursue our own goals and aspirations. By the time you see
                            this page, you will be moving into your new apartment. I'm probably sitting there right beside you, helping you unpack, with a grin on my face at your awe
                            that I built you this webpage as a testimony to show you that I have changed, that you have changed, and that together those differences 
                            are bringing us closer together as we mature throughout our life. I can't wait to go camping, kayaking, climb redrock, to find a new TV series to
                            binge watch afer parker goes to sleep, to go snowboarding for a weekend away, to visit breweries together with our snobby palates, to sit 
                            under the moonlit skies and count the stars in the mountains, travel to colorado or washington or alaska,to see the 
                            Northern Lights and bask in the beauty that is uncomparable to you, to watch our blonde beauty grow up and accel at everything 
                            he does with our guidance and support. Whatever the future holds in store, keep your head up.

                            For whatever the future may hold in store for us, I'll be there for you with open arms and a warm heart. Forever a friend that could always be more.

                        <h2> I Know now...</h2>
                            <p>
                            I did alot of thinking this weekend. And it maybe a bit much to handle or too much to believe. 
                            I love you. Whole heartedly. In times where i doubt being with you, i wind up always looking back 
                            at you and wanting to be with you for the rest of my life. I want to marry you. In a time or in a place
                            where everything will fall into place. When i have the finacial stabillity to buy you the ring i want to propose to
                            you in. With a house that we can call home first. I want to be in a location that will work for us. For you and oarker to
                            attend school and work. And for me to not be able to bitch an moan about the commute. Im not saying anything new... But i
                            am about to. I can see myself in a future with you. I can see us raising another child. All i need is 5-10 years for the secobd
                            child. I know that you may doubt this now. I know that you want to work. But I see. Idont want to be in a situation where i am 
                            frightful of the future. No fears, no tears, just excitement for whats next to come. It may be hard to believe this coming from 
                            me.... I know.... But its true. Its hard for me to perceptually concive a successful plab into the future because
                            life changes. Did you think we would ever be in this situatiob? I kniw i have been an ass with habging out woth other 
                            people and not shoeing you enough affection. From my stand point i need you to say the things that bother you and not get upset.
                            Just tell me that your staying over. To cancel plans smoking because your going to smoke weed abd suck my cick better thab any of my
                            friends can.. I need yoi to say noi dont want to do that i want to do this. Or i don't want to snoke with jarek babe i want to smoke 
                            with you so then we can go cuddle, watch a movie, or bang like crazy kids. At the same time i want to be excited to habgout with you
                            abd your NH friends. I want you to be excited to habgout with me and my friends. I want our lives to join together in a fashion that 
                            there is minimal judgement abd critisim from the actions and thiughts we think in resoect to the degree of the manner. Simply i wabt 
                            you in my life. And i want to be a part of your life. If i want to be a stoner for a coule months i dony want that to be a problem. 
                            If you wabt to hike everyweekend then i dont wabt that to be a problem. Fuck it. Ill smoke a joint at trail head and jogg to catch up 
                            to you guys. Its just the differences in lifestyles and interests, and those things shouldnt be forced but they can be compromised abd
                            im ttying my hardest to find a doable compromise. Idk how your weekend was. We can keep alternsting weekends if we have to for a whike 
                            to be able to clear our heads to pursue what we want. But i will come up every tuesday, wednesday and fridays+ weekends if we dont
                            swap off or go to gimmies or vals or whatever. We need to seriously reduce the amoubt of time at valeries house to once or twice a
                            month.. considering that nothing happened this weekend, i want this to work. I also wabt our parenting styles to mesh into one while
                            being differebt. I just want us to not interupt eachother when we are doing parenting things and i know that is probably the hardest 
                            thing ever because i get mad about you doing it but i do it to you. Im a hippocrite. In summary. I know im the best dad in the world 
                            to Parker. I know that i can provide tge best love in the world that you need. I know we have our differences, Our different beliefs,
                            ideology, and hobbies. That is never going to be a perfect match. Ill make you jealous. Youll maje me jealous. Im so jealous that
                            sometimes I incoherently try to seal you away and make you mine and inly mine. I get so jealous of nothing that im jealous of the
                            boys at this party because i know that they see Jessie Munroe andbwilk jumo at any chance given. That your a people magnet and have
                            gotten free beers and food twice withing the past 4 months. Something i have never done... I think this weekend showed me alot
                            . Showed me that i got comfortable. That I started to take for granted everything i worked so hard to get and it was childish and niave.
                            Because ive been up and down since last sunday night. But as of friday night, my life started to becime more clear. I dont want to have
                            another child because it would be a friend for Parker. Fuck that they can fight and bicker all they want and I would be fine with it. 
                            Because they can hate eachothers guts but they will always have eachothers back. I would want another child for us to give you the
                            enjoyment of having a happy pregnancy and happy child birth. To welcome a beautiful baby into this workd because we know I am an above
                            average dad in terms of compassion, love, guidance, support. And i know those skills only improve. I love us. I hate us. I want us. I
                            dont want to lose the only woman I have cared this much about...
