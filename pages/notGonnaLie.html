                           have yet to climb red rock. I can change that</p>

                        <p>Because why not. Some more red rock! One of america's

                           Paul Bunyan himself. Don't worry, I can wrestle blue ox's

                            <p id="customFontsAbout">It's hard to explain, but the more time we have spent apart, 
                            the more this feels right. Their is no denying that the past month we have spent being
                            more than just friends has been fun, exciting, explorative, and at times romantic.
                            I am, more than ever, certain that we share a covealant bond similar to atoms missing electrons.
                            We aim for a balance among our own personal lives, and the life for our son. I know it's a give and take,
                            with times where we want to spend time together, while balancing our own lives apart and pursue our own goals and aspirations. By the time you see
                            this page, you will be moving into your new apartment. I'm probably sitting there right beside you, helping you unpack, with a grin on my face at your awe
                            that I built you this webpage as a testimony to show you that I have changed, that you have changed, and that together those differences 
                            are bringing us closer together as we mature throughout our life. I can't wait to go camping, kayaking, climb redrock, to find a new TV series to
                            binge watch afer parker goes to sleep, to go snowboarding for a weekend away, to visit breweries together with our snobby palates, to sit 
                            under the moonlit skies and count the stars in the mountains, travel to colorado or washington or alaska,to see the 
                            Northern Lights and bask in the beauty that is uncomparable to you, to watch our blonde beauty grow up and accel at everything 
                            he does with our guidance and support. Whatever the future holds in store, keep your head up.
                            </br></br>
                            For whatever the future may hold in store for us, I'll be there for you with open arms and a warm heart. Forever a friend that could always be more.                            
                            </br></br>
