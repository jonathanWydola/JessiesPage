 I know you don't think I'm ready,
Tough, sincere, or emotionally steady,
But when I said I want you,
genuinely I meant I would see it by through .
You ask me to date, to see another,
It's true I listened but I want this mother,
Just let us explore and cuddle under the stars,
It's a life I want more than the fancy cars.
You make me happy, sleeping on the couch,
Going to the beach, I was always a grouch.
You can't deny we finish each other,
I Wil give you space to with another, 
No longer jealous or afraid of the future,
We could flash like shiny pewter.
It does not mean we have to fuck,
or suck and quack like loving ducks,
Times will be tough, I'm not asking for much,
you would be the last, I want you forever and such.
Now it's even tough your trapped inbetween,
Me and you two different at the seam,
Never felt so grounded for myself,
Lifting me higher in helping yourself.
The rhymes I find guidance,
I believe the experience will enlighten,
The time, never a nuisance,
Left in the dark, the light will brighten,
Our future, your future, my future, the son.
